    "Last lab session we looked at ways of reducing overfitting in our network. The methods we used were either tweaks to the optimisation process (tuning learning rate/batch size, using momentum) or adaptations to the network architecture (batch normalisation).  This week we will look at how we can improve our network's performance through the use of data augmentation techniques. That is, constructing more data from what we already have through the application of transformations (e.g. horizontal flipping, rotation, etc) that preserve the examples' labels. These transformations will introduce more variety into our training data to improve generalisation and reduce overfitting.\n",

    "We'll introduce one final network adaptation, *dropout*, to reduce overfitting.\n",

    "## Data Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Data augmentation refers to the process of applying transforms to existing data that preserves the examples labels. Examples of this include horizontally flipping, cropping, and adding small amounts of noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Online vs. Offline Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we augment our training data? Your first thought might be to apply the transforms and save the new data, additionally training on this new data.\n",
    "This is called **offline augmentation**.\n",
    "An alternative approach is to load an unalterated example from the dataset and apply a transform (like flipping it, or adjusting its brightness) with some probability, this is called **online augmentation**.\n",
    "One of the major benefits of online augmentation is the greater diversity we can achieve in our data: each time the example is loaded it might be transformed in a different way. \n",
    "This is especially true when we apply multiple stochastic transforms one after the other.\n",
    "Offline augmentation is typically used when transform operations are very expensive and computing them online during training would massively slow down the training process due to waiting on the execution of the transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll only be using online augmentation in this lab as the transforms are relatively cheap to apply on the fly. Very few people working with DNNs operating on images use offline augmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyTorch transformation pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, datasets typically have a constructor parameter, `transform`, which you can use to inject an arbitrary transform that is applied to each data sample. Up to this point, our code uses this to convert images from [`PIL.Image.Image`](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#the-image-class) objects to `torch.Tensor` objects by using the [`ToTensor`](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.2.0/torchvision/transforms.html#torchvision.transforms.ToTensor) transform as can be seen in the excerpt below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "transform = transforms.ToTensor()\n",
    "train_dataset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(\n",
    "    args.dataset_root, train=True, download=True, transform=transform\n",
    ")\n",
    "test_dataset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(\n",
    "    args.dataset_root, train=False, download=False, transform=transform\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, we only used a single transform, but it is very common to want to chain multiple transforms together into a pipeline.\n",
    "Torchvision provides a class, [`Compose`](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.2.0/torchvision/transforms.html#torchvision.transforms.Compose), to facilitate this. \n",
    "It is very simple, storing a list of transforms and applying one in turn when it is called on an input.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we could combine random horizontal flipping followed by converting the PIL Images to torch tensors like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "transform = Compose([\n",
    "    torchvision.transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),\n",
    "    torchvision.transforms.ToTensor(),\n",
    "])\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's get some hands on experience and play around the [`CIFAR10`](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.2.0/torchvision/datasets.html#torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10) dataset and the `torchvision` transforms.\n",

    "This will enable us to easily play around with new transforms without having to reconstruct the dataset class with a different transform repeatedly.\n",
    "The [`CIFAR10`](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.2.0/torchvision/datasets.html#torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10) dataset reads images as [`PIL.Image.Image`](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#the-image-class) objects by default.\n",

    "\n",
    "A popular regularisation technique is called **dropout**.\n",
    "Dropout prevents overfitting by randomly removing inputs to a layer. This means that the layer can't rely on a large number of inputs always being present to recognise a specific concept and has to instead rely on fewer combinations of inputs to detect these concepts.\n",
    "The [original paper](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a.old/srivastava14a.pdf) puts forward a good explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Deep neural networks contain multiple non-linear hidden layers and this makes them very expressive models that can learn very complicated relationships between their inputs and outputs. With limited training data, however, many of these complicated relationships will be the result of sampling noise, so they will exist in the training set but not in real test data even if it is drawn from the same distribution.  This leads to overfitting ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout stochastically removes input units, resulting in those units having no effect. Each unit is indepedently dropped-out with probability $p$. The effect of dropout on the network structure can be seen in the figure below\n",
    "\n",
    "![Dropout networks](./media/dropout.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting input units to 0 has the same effect as removing the edges between output neurons and the input units that have been dropped out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, dropout is implemented by sampling a *dropout mask* $\\mathbf{m}$ from a multivariate [Bernoulli distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution) and using this to gate the inputs.\n",
    "For a layer with $D$ inputs, $D$ binary samples are drawn from $\\mathrm{B}(1-p)$ (a Bernoulli distribution with mean $1-p$) to form $\\mathbf{m} \\in \\{0, 1\\}^D$. The inputs $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$ are then gated by the dropout mask $\\mathbf{x}\\odot \\mathbf{m}$ (where $\\odot$ represents elementwise multiplication) before being passed into the layer.\n",
    "As previously stated, this only happens during training, and at test time the inputs are left untouched.\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue we haven't noted with the above formulation is the difference in input distributions to the layer during training vs. testing.\n",
    "Consider dropping out the inputs to a fully connected layer. \n",
    "Let's look at one of the neurons in the layer, each of which are connected to the $D$ inputs.\n",
    "The expected input to a neuron during training will be \n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{m} \\odot \\mathbf{x}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{m}] \\odot \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{x}] = (1-p) \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{x}]$$\n",
    "but during testing it will instead be $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{x}]$.\n",
    "So, the expected difference between training and testing in the input to the neuron is $\\frac{1}{1-p}$.\n",
    "This is easily resolvable by rescaling the inputs during training, we simply weight the inputs by $\\frac{1}{1-p}$ during training and leave them untouched during testing. This keeps the expected value of the inputs the same during testing or training.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [original paper](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a.old/srivastava14a.pdf) for more details, it is eminently readable. Be aware that they define $p$ to be the probability that a neuron is retained, rather than dropped, most frameworks these days define it like we have defined above. The scaling used to keep the expected value of the inputs the same during training and testing also differs to that above, but achieves the same end.\n",

For example you could store your command line args so you can determine what hyperparameters were used to train that particular model. Another good idea is to save the accuracy the model achieves in validation, e.g.:\n",
