    "\n",
    "We will help you set up SSH so you can connect to [BlueCrystal 4 (BC4)](https://www.acrc.bris.ac.uk/acrc/phase4.htm) \n",
    "and ensure that you have got your environment set up correctly. We'll also discuss some of the basics of the system, \n",

    "  \n",
    "  **NOTE:** Make sure to replace `<UoB-username>` with your actual username, e.g. `wp14283`.\n",
    "- If you don't already have an SSH key `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, then generate one with `ssh-keygen` accepting all the defaults.\n",
    "- If you're on a Unix system, copy your SSH public key over to seis and BC4:\n",

    "  ssh-copy-id seis\n",
    "  ssh-copy-id bc4-external\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Note this will prompt you to enter your password so `ssh-copy-id` can login and copy your public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote server.\n",
    "- If you are on Windows, to copy your SSH key, you will need to run something like:\n",
    "  ```console\n",
    "  cat $env:userprofile/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh seis 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'\n",
    "  cat $env:userprofile/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh bc4-external 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Check that `ssh bc4-external` logs onto BC4 without prompting you for your password.\n",
    "- If you are inside the university network, you can login to BC4 with `ssh bc4`"
