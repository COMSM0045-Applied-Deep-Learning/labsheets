    "We will help you set up SSH so you can connect to [BlueCrystal 4 (BC4)](https://www.acrc.bris.ac.uk/acrc/phase4.htm) \n",
    "and ensure that you have got your environment set up correctly. We'll also discuss some of the basics of the system, \n",

    "**Windows users only:**\n",
    "If you're running windows, [enable WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and install the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS distribution from the Microsoft Store. Once installed, open up the Ubuntu application which should launch a bash shell. WSL keeps the linux filesystem separate from the Windows one, however Windows drives are mounted at `/mnt/<drive-letter>`, allowing you to transparently access files on your Windows machine from the Ubuntu subsystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are unable to install WSL, then follow the steps in [Windows setup: Non-WSL](#Windows-setup:-Non-WSL)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The following steps should be followed by everyone**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open up `~/.ssh/config` in your editor and add the following lines\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  # file: ~/.ssh/config\n",
    "  Host seis\n",
    "      User <UoB-username>\n",

    "      ProxyJump seis  # This only works on SSH 7.3+\n",
    "      # For older versions of SSH that don't support ProxyJump,\n",
    "      # remove the above line and uncomment the one below \n",
    "      #ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p seis\n",

    "      HostName bc4login.acrc.bris.ac.uk\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Then run `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config` so it is only readable by you.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **NOTE:** Make sure to replace `<UoB-username>` with your actual username, e.g. `wp14283`.\n",
    "- If you don't already have an SSH key `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, then generate one with `ssh-keygen` accepting all the defaults.\n",
    "- Copy you SSH public key over to seis and BC4\n",

    "  \n",
    "  Note this will prompt you to enter your password so `ssh-copy-id` can login and copy your public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote server.\n",
    "- Check that `ssh bc4-external` logs onto BC4 without prompting you for your password.\n",
