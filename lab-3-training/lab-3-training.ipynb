The **training accuracy** (~70%) could be higher; this dataset has 10 classes, so chance performance would be 10%. *Make sure you distinguish between the training curve and the test/validation curve for both loss and accuracy*. This indicates that our model is underfitting the training data. Our training performance, in normal circumstances, is typically an upper bound of the accuracy we can expect on the test set. In fact, as a rule of thumb, it is a good idea to overfit your training data, then regularise the model to reduce the train-validation gap in order to generalise to future data.\n",

    "\n",
    "The distribution of each layer's input, i.e. either the input data itself or the output from the previous hidden layer, plays a crucial role when training. This distribution varies during training. This phenomenon is known as *internal covariate shift*.\n",

It was proposed in 2015 by Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy at Google in [Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf). Let's see how it works. \n",

    "\n",
    "> By fixing the distribution of the layer inputs as the training progresses, we expect to improve the training speed. It has been long known that the network training converges faster if its inputs are whitened – i.e., linearly transformed to have zero means and unit variances, and decorrelated. As each layer observes the inputs produced by the layers below, it would be advantageous to achieve the same whitening of the inputs of each layer.\n",

    "- The mean $\\mu_c$ and variance $\\sigma_c^2$ are computed over each training batch\n",
    "- $\\epsilon$ is a small constant for numerical stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue with batch normalisation is that whilst it speeds up convergence, it restricts the possible functions the neural network can approximate. To restore the representational power of the network, two new parameters per channel are learnt: a multiplier $\\gamma_c$ and a bias $\\beta_c$ to adapt the mean and variance of the normalised input. Refer to your lectures for more details. \n",

    "- Remember you should define the layers in the `__init__` method of your `CNN` class and then call it in the `forward` pass after performing the convolution and before the activation function. Each BatchNorm layer will have different input dimensions and will need to learn different parameters, so it is important that you define separate BatchNorm layers in your `__init__` method.\n",
    "- Change `tb_log_dir_prefix` in `get_summary_writer_log_dir` to read `f'CNN_bn_bs={args.batch_size}_lr={args.learning_rate}_run_'` (this way we can distinguish our logs from the batch normalised networks and the un-normalised networks).\n",
    "- Train your network with BS=128 and LR=1e-1. Expect to get an accuracy of ~74%.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Whilst batch normalisation was originally motivated by the desire to reduce internal covariate shift, a [recent analysis](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7996-understanding-batch-normalization.pdf) of the technique suggest that the key benefit of the technique is to constrain activations to zero mean and unit variance. Without this constraint, very deep networks (e.g. 110 layer ResNets) suffer from increasingly large activations with depth in the network. These large activations cause the network to diverge (the loss increases without bound) during training. Consequently deep networks without batch normalisation have to be trained with smaller learning rates than their batch normalised equivalents. The larger learning rates help reduce over fitting of the network, speed up convergence, and tend to improve the final accuracy too!\n",
