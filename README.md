If you have trouble viewing the labsheets on github, you can try using the
[NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/COMSM0045-Applied-Deep-Learning/labsheets/tree/master/) service provided by ipython.org.

## Environments

In these labs we'll be using two computing environments:

- [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) (a hosted version of Jupyter notebooks) for exploring PyTorch and dabbling with simple and non-computationally expensive experiments.
- Lab Machines for GPU accelerated experiments.

If instead you'd like to install Jupyter locally on your laptop,
[we provide some guidance on a best efforts basis](./misc/local-environment-setup.ipynb).
If you have trouble setting things up then we'd recommend using Colaboratory instead.

If you'd like to connect to BC4, [we provide guidance for SSH setup](./misc/bc4-setup.ipynb).

## Problems
Kindly file an
[issue](https://github.com/COMSM0045-Applied-Deep-Learning/labsheets/issues)
with a description of the problem you're facing, your setup, what you are
observing and what you expect to happen instead.
